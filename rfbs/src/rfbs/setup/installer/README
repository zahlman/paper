This package contains the code from `installer` version 0.4.0
(https://pypi.org/project/installer/0.4.0/) by Pradyun Gedam.

The Windows-specific executable wrappers (.exe files in `_scripts`)
have been removed to save space. The hope is that in the final product,
these wrappers will only need to be downloaded when on Windows.

Some from-imports have been changed from absolute to relative. This is
necessary with the current setup, because Flit will only include a
single top-level package per distribution, so `installer` can't be
defined as a top-level name. (Alternately, the code could be changed to
import from `rfbs.setup.installer`; but this is cleaner.)

Similarly, some absolute imports have been changed to do a relative
from-import of the appropriate symbol, and the code adapted to use the
new imported name.

The code to for installing Windows-specific wrappers has also been
altered to avoid errors and generally simplify. `_ALLOWED_LAUNCHERS`
has been emptied out, and the code that would have looked up the
corresponding .exe and read its binary data is removed. (The
compatibility layer for locating and reading the file is also removed.)
